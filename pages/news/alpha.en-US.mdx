# Xinux Alpha Release

In 2020 we altogether created this community and started working on open source & linux projects. Today is the day which we awaited so long.

## What’s New

### Channeling System

Channeling System were created in order to create operation systems faster without loosing its efficiency and productivity. We believe that every task has its own efficient way of execution.
To reach that efficiency, we have to create a specialized operation system for every kind of task that will focus on only it. However, you might have questioned yourself whether how we could produce various
images and don't have bad impact on it? Simply by removing unnecessary tools and drivers by leaving only important things will boost the system. Also, by assembling production ready configurations
we can save some time for users to set it up and improve the productivity. Currently, we have only Desktop Edition which was meant for home usage. Sooner, we will be adding 5 more channels.

#### Now:

- Desktop Edition

#### Later:

- DNS Edition
- Server Edition
- Developer Edition
- Designer Edition
- Enterprise Edition

### Mirror

We created our own packages and stored it in our own mirror server. In order to use our mirror & install our packages, you have to download and install our gpg public key.

```shell
curl -Lo - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzinfocom-org/keyring/main/xinux.gpg" \
    | pacman-key -a -

pacman-key --lsign-key info@uzinfocom.uz

pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate xinux
```

then you can add our mirrorlist to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

```yaml
[xinux]
SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional
Server = https://mirror.xinux.uz/$repo/$arch/
Server = http://mirror.dc.uz/$repo/$repo/$arch/
Server = https://mirror.dc.uz/$repo/$repo/$arch/
```

## What’s Next

In future releases, we will stabilize our channeling system and add more channels to it. Also optimize existing channels to make it performant.
