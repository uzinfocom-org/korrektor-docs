## Drivers

Regarding to driver, you may ask for help in our telegram community or refer to official [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)

## Software

Software can be installed from Pamac. If you're coming from Ubuntu or Debianoid operating systems, you may use apt!

<Callout emoji="😂">
  Hey, apt in Xinux is just a bind for pacman. We lied to you telling we have literally apt installed.
