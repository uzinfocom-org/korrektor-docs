## Our Community

It's no secret that Xinux has a personal community on Telegram with more than 500 members. Until recently, our
participants expressed numerous protests about the "separation of people" and it turns out that Xinux separates a person from himself?
No! The main goal of our society is to promote Linux among these people and develop it. However the Xinux society strives
to do this within the framework of distributions belonging to the Arch family and only Arch. But with this, we have never recommended
staying away from other distributions not based on Arch. Each distribution has its own main purpose, and others
distributions may not achieve this goal in this distribution. The main reason why Xinux chose Arch is
that Arch is a good choice for learning Linux distribution and is one of those distributions that can provide
the new generation with everything they need to learn the anatomy of Linux in general. There are also other similar Gentoo and LFS distributions.
But it was within the framework of Arch Linux that it was decided to leave, because these distributions were more complex than Arch. In this group
it is not forbidden to talk about other distributions, but at the same time it is strictly forbidden to complain about the
help not provided for questions not asked within the framework of Arch, Gentoo or LFS.
